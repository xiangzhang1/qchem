NN is not numerically stable. for complex models, 10% breakdowns happen just due to numerical instability.

Go for prior knowledge, whatever the cost.

Implementation should not be a problem.

'Mathematical construction, evaluation, iteration'.

NN does not generalize. Use it only when reliable global data can be obtained.
