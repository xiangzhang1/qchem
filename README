Fragile parts:

qchem.Node.readable_list: which vars to read.

sigma.var = config.{{{tmp}}}: which vars to print.

gui.beautify_json: id->label, etc. relatively stable.

gui.traverse_json: [cur, some_identifier, {key:val}]. relatively stable.


Temporary fixes:

I just disabled return_through. Remember to patch it back.
